# PPI_GNN

**PPI_GNN** is a graph-based deep learning approach that uses 3D protein structures to predict interactions between protein pairs.

This repository includes code for dataset creation, feature extraction, graph construction, and training a GNN model for binary protein-protein interaction prediction.
