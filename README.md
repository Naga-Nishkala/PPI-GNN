# 🔬 PPI_GNN

**PPI_GNN** is a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework designed to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) 🤝 using 3D structural information 🧬.  
It integrates curated datasets of positive and negative protein pairs, processes their structures, and trains a deep model to classify interaction likelihoods.

📦 The required data to run the GNN is already included in the repository.
